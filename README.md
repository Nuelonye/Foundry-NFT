# 🐶 NFT Smart Contracts — BasicNft & MoodNft (Foundry)

This project showcases two Solidity NFT contracts built and tested using **Foundry**:  
- **BasicNft (Doggie)** — a simple NFT minting contract using off-chain metadata (IPFS).  
- **MoodNft** — an on-chain NFT that changes its displayed mood (Happy/Sad).
